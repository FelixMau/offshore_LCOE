# offshore_LCOE
Student Project to estimate LCOE and Energyharvest for offshore windturbines in Germany


## Tools

### [Windpowerlib](https://windpowerlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Wind resource assessment: It provides functions to estimate the wind resource at a specific location using wind speed time series data.

- Turbine power curves: It includes models to represent the power output of different wind turbine types based on their power curves.

- Wind farm modeling: The package allows you to simulate the power output of a wind farm based on the layout and characteristics of the turbines.

- Electrical components modeling: It includes models to simulate electrical losses, transformer efficiency, and other electrical components' behavior in a wind power system.
